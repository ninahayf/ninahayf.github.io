Hi, I'm Nina Hayford. I am a Junior at Colorado State University. I'm majoring in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability in the Warner College of Natural Resources.

In the Spring of 2025 I took a Quantitative Reasoning class based in R. I learned how to make and find files within my computer through RStudio, I learned how to navigate complicated instructions, and learned how to make a website through this software!

I now value the power of office hours and asking for help when I am confused or do not know how to do something.

-   In this assignment we built a static users site with Github Pages.

-   Includes a github repo for access to all the code.
