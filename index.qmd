Hi, I'm Nina Hayford. I am a Junior at Colorado State University. I'm majoring in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability in the Warner College of Natural Resources.

<https://ninahayf.github.io/csu-ess-lab3/lab-03.html>

-   In this lab I learned how to create maps and tables using the flextable feature

-   I also learned how to use GitHub Pages to make your rendered .html file into a website!
